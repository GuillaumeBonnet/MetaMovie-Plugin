# personal notes

- node-sass worked with node v12 but not node v15
  after switching to v12 and back to v15 it somehow works
  if the bug resurfaces switch to dart-sass https://sass-lang.com/dart-sass

- The most important thing to understand about using Tailwind with a preprocessor is that preprocessors like Sass, Less, and Stylus run separately, before Tailwind.
